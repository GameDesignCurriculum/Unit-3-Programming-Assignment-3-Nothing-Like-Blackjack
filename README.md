# Assignment Description
Imagine you've decided to write a program to play a game that's nothing like Blackjack. You hope to get rich by selling your game to the casinos in Las Vegas, so you want to do a great job!
In this assignment, you'll deal one card to four players, deal another card to the same four players, then give one more card to a couple of the players. Finally, you'll flip over and print the cards for each player. You might as well start shopping for your new McLaren now ...
Hint: If you deal the cards properly, player 1 will end up with the King of Spades and the 9 of Spades.
# Why do we care?
This assignment gives you valuable practice using classes and objects. Because we use object-oriented programming to write our Unity games (coming soon!), we need to understand how to use classes and objects.
